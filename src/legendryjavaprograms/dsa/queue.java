//Explain about queue?
//If you're asked about the `Queue` interface in an interview, you can provide a concise yet comprehensive explanation. Hereâ€™s how you could structure your response:
//
//---
//
//**1. **Introduction to Queue Interface:**
//   
//   "The `Queue` interface in Java is part of the `java.util` package and represents a collection designed for holding elements prior to processing. It follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, meaning that the elements are added at the end of the queue and removed from the front."
//
//**2. **Key Characteristics:**
//   
//   - **FIFO Ordering:** "Elements in a `Queue` are ordered in a FIFO manner. The first element added will be the first one to be removed."
//   - **Methods:** "`Queue` provides several important methods, such as `add()`, `offer()`, `remove()`, `poll()`, `element()`, and `peek()`. `add()` and `remove()` throw exceptions if the operation fails, while `offer()` and `poll()` return special values (true/false or null) instead."
//   - **Null Handling:** "Most implementations of `Queue` do not allow `null` elements, as `null` is often used as a special return value to indicate the absence of an element."
//
//**3. **Implementations:**
//   
//   - "There are several implementations of the `Queue` interface in Java, each suited for different use cases. Common implementations include:
//    ** - `LinkedList`: A doubly-linked list implementation that can be used as a queue.
//     - `PriorityQueue`: A queue where elements are ordered according to their natural ordering or by a `Comparator`.
//     - `ArrayDeque`: An implementation that can be used as both a queue and a stack.
//     **- `BlockingQueue` and its subtypes (`ArrayBlockingQueue`, `LinkedBlockingQueue`, etc.): Used in concurrent programming to block when attempting to add to a full queue or remove from an empty one."
//
//**4. **Use Cases:**
//   
//   - "Queues are commonly used in scenarios where we need to manage tasks or events in the order they occur, such as task scheduling, breadth-first search algorithms, and implementing producer-consumer problems."
//
//**5. **Advantages:**
//   
//   - "Queues provide a clean and straightforward way to handle ordered processing, support multiple implementations for flexibility, and are foundational for several concurrent data structures in Java."
//
//**6. **Final Point:**
//   
//   - "By using the `Queue` interface, we can design our code to be more flexible, as we can easily switch between different implementations without changing the code that uses the queue."
